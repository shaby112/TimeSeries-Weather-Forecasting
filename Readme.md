# Weather Forecasting Project

I developed a time-series weather forecasting project using Facebook's NeuralProphet model. Utilizing a curated dataset from Kaggle, I provided accurate predictions of mean temperature for London. 

The model was trained and exported in pkl. The trained file is included in the repository.
